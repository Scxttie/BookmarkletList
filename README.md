## FAQ

#### Question 1

Are these safe?
Yes. All of them have been used, and checked.

#### Question 2

Who are the makers of these **Bookmarklets**?

Go to the [Credits](https://github.com/Scxttie/BookmarkletList/blob/main/Credits.txt) page.


## Installation

Just Drag the Blue text into your Bookmarks bar, then go to whatever site you'd like to run it on. Then you just click the Bookmark. It should then run.

**IF IT DOESN'T**

The Website may not allow you to run whatever you're trying to run. To my knowledge. There's no way to bypass this.
